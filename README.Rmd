**pottR** is a personal utility package that brings together functions I regularly use in my work—primarily for data summarisation, presentation, and formatting.

The aim of this package is twofold:  
- To simplify repetitive workflows in my day-to-day R projects.  
- To build confidence and familiarity with R package development best practices.  

---

## Installation

You can install the development version of **pottR** directly from GitHub:

```r
# Install devtools if not already installed
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("jasonpott/pottR")
usethis::use_logo("pottr_hex.png")
```

## Example

Below is an example showing several utility functions in action, applied to the built-in `mtcars` dataset.

```{r example}
library(pottR)
library(dplyr)
library(gt)

mtcars |>
  group_by(cyl) |>
  summarise(
    mileage = mean_sd(mpg),
    med_disp = med_iqr(disp),
    pro_with_more_than_3_gears = prop_n_greater(
      variable = gear,
      value_of_interest = 3,
      rounding_value = 1
    ),
    pro_with_3_gears = prop_n(
      variable = gear,
      value_of_interest = 3,
      rounding_value = 1
    )
  )
```
