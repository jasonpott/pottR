pottR is a public personal package that brings together utility functions that I use in my work.

My goal with the package was to increase my familiarity with R package development while making my code easier to use in my day to day work.


## Installation

You can install the development version of pottR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jasonpott/pottR")
```

## Example

Below is an example of some of the functions and how they might be used.

```{r example}
library(pottR)

mtcars |>
  group_by(cyl) |>
  summarise(
    mileage = pottR::mean_sd(mpg),
    med_disp = pottR::med_iqr(disp),
    pro_with_more_than_3_gears = pottR::prop_n_greater(
      variable = gear,
      value_of_interest = 3,
      rounding_value = 3
    ),
    pro_with_3_gears = pottR::prop_n(
      variable = gear,
      value_of_interest = 3,
      rounding_value = 3
    )
  ) |>
  gt::gt() |>
  gt_pottr(footnote = "This is a footnote")
```
